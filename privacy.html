      <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

      <p>Circl ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Circl mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
      <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for authentication and account recovery</li>
        <li><strong>Phone number</strong> — used for contact matching and account identification</li>
        <li><strong>Full name</strong> — displayed to other users</li>
        <li><strong>Username</strong> — your unique identifier within the App</li>
        <li><strong>Profile picture</strong> — optionally uploaded by you</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Device Contacts</h3>
      <p>With your explicit permission, we access your device's contact list (names, phone numbers, and email addresses) to help you find people you know on Circl. Contact data is synced to our servers and stored securely. You can revoke contact access at any time through your device settings.</p>

      <h3>1.3 Content You Create</h3>
      <p>We store content you create within the App, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Questions you ask</li>
        <li>Responses you submit</li>
        <li>Comments and reactions</li>
        <li>Media attachments (images, videos, audio)</li>
        <li>Lists and groups you create or join</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.4 Device Information</h3>
      <p>We collect your device's push notification token to deliver notifications. We also collect basic device information (platform type: iOS or Android) for service functionality.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App</li>
        <li>Authenticate your identity and secure your account</li>
        <li>Match your contacts to existing Circl users</li>
        <li>Deliver questions, responses, and notifications</li>
        <li>Send SMS invitations on your behalf (see Section 3)</li>
        <li>Store and serve media you upload</li>
        <li>Enforce our Terms of Service</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. SMS Messaging Program</h2>
      <p>Circl offers an SMS invite feature that allows users to send question invitations to contacts who are not yet on the App.</p>

      <h3>3.1 Consent</h3>
      <p>SMS messages are sent only when a Circl user explicitly chooses to invite a contact to respond to a specific question. The inviting user initiates each message. By using the SMS invite feature, you (the sender) confirm that you have a prior relationship with the recipient and believe they would want to receive the invitation.</p>

      <h3>3.2 Message Content and Frequency</h3>
      <p>Each SMS contains the sender's name, the question text, and a link to respond. Recipients will receive a maximum of <strong>2 SMS messages per 6-month period</strong>. Senders are limited to <strong>10 SMS invitations per day</strong>. Message and data rates may apply.</p>

      <h3>3.3 Opting Out</h3>
      <p>Recipients can opt out of future SMS messages by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message received from Circl. You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:circlproject2026@gmail.com">circlproject2026@gmail.com</a> to request removal from our SMS recipient list. Once opted out, you will receive no further SMS messages from Circl.</p>

      <h3>3.4 Help</h3>
      <p>For help with SMS messages, reply <strong>HELP</strong> to any message or contact us at <a href="mailto:circlproject2026@gmail.com">circlproject2026@gmail.com</a>.</p>
