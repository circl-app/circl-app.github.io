      <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Circl mobile application (the "App") operated by Circl ("we," "us," or "our"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use Circl. By creating an account, you represent that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you represent that you have parental or guardian consent to use the App.</p>

      <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You agree to provide accurate and complete information when creating your account. You may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create accounts for other people without their permission</li>
        <li>Use another person's account</li>
        <li>Create multiple accounts for deceptive purposes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

      <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use Circl to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Harass, bully, threaten, or intimidate others</li>
        <li>Send spam, unsolicited messages, or bulk invitations to people you don't know</li>
        <li>Post or share content that is illegal, defamatory, obscene, or infringes on others' rights</li>
        <li>Impersonate another person or entity</li>
        <li>Attempt to access other users' accounts or data without authorization</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality or infrastructure</li>
        <li>Use the App for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent</li>
        <li>Use automated systems or bots to interact with the App</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. SMS Invitations</h2>
      <p>Circl allows you to send SMS invitations to your contacts. By using this feature, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have a prior personal relationship with each recipient</li>
        <li>You will not use the feature to send unsolicited messages to strangers</li>
        <li>You will respect recipients who opt out by replying STOP</li>
        <li>You accept the rate limits we impose (maximum 10 SMS invitations per day, maximum 2 messages per recipient per 6-month period)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Message and data rates may apply to SMS recipients. We reserve the right to suspend the SMS invite feature for any user who abuses it.</p>

      <h2>5. Your Content</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of content you create on Circl (questions, responses, comments, media). By posting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, display, and distribute your content within the App as necessary to provide the service.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for the content you post. We may remove content that violates these Terms or applicable law.</p>

      <h2>6. Other Users' Content</h2>
      <p>Content posted by other users represents their views, not ours. We do not endorse, verify, or guarantee the accuracy of user-generated content. You interact with other users and their content at your own discretion.</p>

      <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your data. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>8. Contact Access</h2>
      <p>If you grant Circl access to your device contacts, you represent that you have the authority to share that contact information for the purpose of finding existing Circl users and sending invitations. You can revoke contact access at any time through your device settings.</p>

      <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>The App, including its design, code, logos, and branding, is owned by Circl and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App without our prior written consent.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may delete your account at any time from within the App. Upon deletion, your personal data will be permanently removed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without cause or notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or if required by law.</p>

      <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. We disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Circl shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or personal harm resulting from interactions with other users.</p>

      <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Circl and its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the App, your content, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms within the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the courts of California.</p>
